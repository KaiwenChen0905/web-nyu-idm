   <div class= "Photo2">
    <h3>is a picture I took when we first met. At that time, I was the director of our school's club fest film while Karen is the main actress in the film. This was the first time we met. When I was taking photos of her for the film poster, we had a nice long chat in the classroom alone. We start to be intersted at each other through the conversation. We found that we have a lot in common and it was really pleasant to talk with each other. From that time, our lives intertwined. </h3>
