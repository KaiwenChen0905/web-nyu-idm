  <h1>The Doorcard</h1>
    <h2>The doorcard is the key to my dormroom.My dorm in Clark Street is my first place to stay in this unfamiliar city. Since I am a virgo, I have a strong Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. So I would make my room as clean and tidy as possible. The room is not very big, but it is enough for my daily life. I spend most of my time here to play, rest and sleep. There are a lot of restaurants and convenient stores near my dorm, so it is quite convenient living here. (!click the picture!)</h2>
